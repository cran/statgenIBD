* It is now possible to specify chromosomes in character format, i.e. 1a, 1b, 1c as is common in certain crops.
* The plot function for calculated IBD probabilities now has an extra option `plotType` that can have values "singleGeno", for the original plot, and "allGeno" for a new plot showing probabilities for all genotypes in a single plot.
* A bug that in some cases could lead to misnaming of the markers when combining multiple imputed populations is fixed.
