\usage{
calcIBD(
  popType,
  markerFile,
  mapFile,
  evalPos = NULL,
  evalDist = NULL,
  grid = TRUE,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{popType}{A character string indicating the type of population. One of
DH, Fx, FxDH, BCx, BCxDH, BC1Sx, BC1SxDH, C3, C3DH, C3Sx, C3SxDH, C4, C4DH,
C4Sx, C4SxDH (see Details).}

\item{markerFile}{A character string indicating the location of the file with
genotypic information for the population. The file should be in
tab-delimited format with a header containing marker names.}

\item{mapFile}{A character string indicating the location of the map file
for the population. The file should be in tab-delimited format. It should
consist of exactly three columns, marker, chromosome and position. There
should be no header. The positions in the file should be in centimorgan.}

\item{evalPos}{A data.frame with evaluation positions to which the
calculations should be limited.}

\item{evalDist}{An optional numerical value indicating the maximum
distance for marker positions. Extra markers will be added based on the
value of \code{grid}.}

\item{grid}{Should the extra markers that are added to assure the a
maximum distince of \code{evalDist} be on a grid (\code{TRUE}) or in between
marker existing marker positions (\code{FALSE}).}

\item{verbose}{Should messages indicating the progress of the process be
printed?}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{IBDprob}, a \code{list} with five elements,
\describe{
\item{map}{a \code{data.frame} with chromosome and position of the markers.}
\item{markers}{a 3-dimensional \code{array} of IBD probabilities with
genotypes, markers and parents as array dimensions.}
\item{parents}{the parents.}
\item{popType}{the population type.}
}
}
\description{
Calculate IBD probabilities for different types of populations.
}
\details{
IBD probabilities can be calculated for many different types of populations.
In the following table all supported populations are listed. Note that the
value of x in the population types is variable, with its maximum value
depicted in the last column.\tabular{llll}{
